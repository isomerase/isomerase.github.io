## Travel

- I am currently building my tiny home inside a retired news crew van.
- I have been to 26 countries so far! I've done 3 major bicycle tours (from Seattle to San Francisco, around Taiwan, and around New Zealand).
- I've hitchhiked over 10,000 miles in the US, Taiwan, Thailand, Australia, and New Zealand.

## Talks and Interviews

- Talk for TA3M Seattle: "How  AI can be abused by surveillance states" ([presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lfn3T7R-ufjbzfmlVSMgAIyjC6hYhTTC41LMleQNFcQ/edit?usp=sharing))
- Interview with KOMO news in Seattle over the net neutrality debate
- Interview with [Edventure Project](http://edventureproject.com): [Why we pick up hitchhikers](http://edventureproject.com/why-we-pick-up-hitchhikers/)

## Art

- I was Artist in Residence at the [Sir James Wallace Arts Trust](www.wallaceartstrust.org.nz) for a few months in 2015. A selection of my works are in circulation around public spaces in New Zealand.

## Computing

- **Home server** - I am proud of my home server. I built it myself and run the following services: wallabag, owncloud, bittorrent, ZeroNet, IPFS, and Tor node.
- **[Mobile library](https://github.com/PirateBox-Dev/PirateBox-Mesh)** - I converted a Raspberry Pi into an awesome mobile filesharing mesh network.

## Volunteering, Activism, Organizing

- I organized and led a protest against Congress's plans to end the Internet's decentralized nature. Downtown Seattle, December 2014.
- I spent a month and a half volunteering full-time on Mota Lava, Vanuatu. I was helping communities be more resilient by teaching them to make virgin coconut oil and facilitating business deals. I gave various lectures at the local school and helped get paint for the local church.
- I've volunteered on various organic farms and intentional communities, including the [Awaawaroa Bay Eco Village](https://www.facebook.com/awaawaroabay) and [Wilderland Trust](https://www.facebook.com/WilderlandTrust/), and various other WWOOF and HelpX hosts.
- I was a full-time volunteer for a community science project monitorizing how the worlds largest LPG processing center would affect the world's largest Humpack whale calving area near James Price Point, Australia.
- I've been part of the [Couchsurfing](couchsurfing.org) community since 2011 ([profile](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/rovingrichard)).
- I have been a Wikipedia editor since 2008 ([profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Richard.decal)).
