<span class="fa fa-person about-icon"></span>
I'm a series of spacetime events called Ricardo (or Richard). I was born in Florida to Cuban and Argentine parents (español es mi lengua materna). I'm a high tech low-life, an outdoorsy great indoorsman; voice-activated, user-friendly, self-cleaning, and compostable. I'm a non-believer and an overachiever, laid-back but forward-thinking, a supercharged subversive, a hands-on footloose. I'm a relentless nerd and SJW.

I have worked as a researcher at various universities &ndash; for a full list of peer-reviewed publications and projects, see my <strong><a href="/cv">CV page</a></strong>. I have many scientific interests: computational neuroscience, neural networks, cell biology, astronomy, cryptography, and more.

<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
My goal is to use <strong>artifical intelligence technology for social good</strong>. Specifically, I dream of making pedagocial chatbots. This lies right at the interface of my various passions: machine learning, education, and social justice.

I've also worked a bunch of non-academic jobs. I was an artist and residence for Sir James Wallace of the Wallace Arts Trust. I'm also starting my own business (details to follow)!

After graduating in 2011, I bought a 1-way ticket to China. I've spent 4 of the past 5 years hitchhiking, backpacking, and bicycling around the world-- been to 27 countries so far.Lessons learned: I'm really good at being frugal!
