## Projects

### Reinforcement Learning for Tracing Neuron Morphologies
_[Hanchuan Peng](https://www.alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/research/products-tools/vaa3d/) lab. [Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://www.alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/), Seattle, WA, USA - Summer 2018_

I made a proof of concept showing that deep reinforcement learning can be used to automatically trace neuron morphologies.

### Mosquito thermal plume tracking
_[Adrienne Fairhall](www.fairhalllab.com) lab. [University of Washington](uw.edu), Dept. of Physiology and Biophysics, Seattle, WA, USA - 2014 → 2016_

I worked as a research assistant in Fairhall Lab. We're interested in answering how the history of sensory experience affects decision-making. As a model, we use mosquitoes host-seeking behavior, as carbon dioxide and thermal signals are known to inform their search. These thermal and olfactory cues have a complicated and sparse structure due to turbulence. How do mosquitoes use spatially- and temporally-sparse information to navigate to hosts? With the Daniel, Riffell and Dickinson labs, we study the behavioral and neurophysiological responses of mosquitoes to temporal patterns in heat and CO2 plumes, which we then use to develop models for multisensory integration.

My current role in the project is creating models of mosquitoes tracking turbulent thermal plumes and benchmark those models against wind-tunnel behavioral data. In particular, I am creating driven, damped agent-based dynamical models which reproduce mosquito baseline flight and then test various strategies for plume navigation. These models will be further validated using electrophysiological and tethered flight data to test theories about multi-modal decision making.


### Humpback Whale Census
_[Kimberley Community Whale Research Project](https://kimberleycommunitywhaleresearch.wordpress.com/), Murdudun, Australia - 2012_

A community-initiated peer-review at the proposed site of the world’s second-largest liquefied gas processing port. Our peer-review’s estimates of humpback migration and breeding activity near James Price Point revealed gross discrepancies in the original oil conglomerate’s survey.

### Mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease
_[Leo Pallanck](http://www.gs.washington.edu/faculty/pallanck.htm) lab. [University of Washington](uw.edu), Dept. of Genome Sciences, Seattle, WA, USA - 2015 → 2016_

I helped establish a method to grow, stain, and image primary dopaminergic neural culture from Drosophila embryos in order to test whether Parkin and PINK1, proteins involved in Parkinson’s disease, are recruited to depolarized mitochondria in dopaminergic neurons. This research was published in PNAS.

### Quantifying endogenous sRNA concentrations in _C. elegans_
_[Katherine Walstrom](https://www.ncf.edu/directory/listing/katherine-walstrom/) lab. [New College of Florida](ncf.edu), Dept. of Natural Sciences, Sarasota, FL, USA - 2010 → 2011_

My thesis proposes a model for RNA Helicase A function in endogenous _C. elegans_ RNAi pathways.
